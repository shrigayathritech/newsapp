1.lets start with login/sign up button and logout button .
2.i think do we need to convert it link in order to move to that page to do routing?
3.give frontend and backend code with simple login/sigup and logout with mango db

great , now lets focuss on adding news letter feature in header before login/signup,
i want form to collect user details including to directly mail users real time trending news in email.
    1.name, 
    2.mail id
    3. country 
    4. area of interest in news categories(politic, entertainment , business, latest news , hotnews , technology, news by region for local news ) 
user can select multiple news category in form only after login/signup, if user try to fill form ask them to login /sign up by notification msg!

1.refer the previous chats , also ask if u need any code!...we already have authentication for filling newsletter only for login/signup user ,
2.similarly i want like reaction to be functional (only authenticated user can react), save the liked news separately , by creating a user profile 
3.user profile should show logged mail id , name(with edit option), saved liked post ,logout

1. login/signup +user profile
2. reaction + save liked post 
3. newsletter + email the subscribed news categories + free/ also pricing
4. image news + video news + content creator + monitization for creator +community discussion
5. directly share news article to image news within application + other social media 
5. user profile 
6. logout
7. themes
remember the colour theme of the website black bagroung , buttons blue , text white , border neon green , include yellow if needed

listen carefully i dont have routes code for login/signup(single button) u give code functional with good css , when clicked show signup page , forgot password, login option also
1. login/signup (focus on frontend later integrate with backend and mongodb)
login detail in form:
    1.user mail id 
    2.password
signup detail in form:
    1.user name
    2.user mail id
    3.password
2. user profile 
    after login/signup show user profile with drop down option 
        1.edit user name
        2.show logged in mail id
        3.saved liked post 
        4.creator(which later shows page with 3 nav section for photo news, video news, creator option)
        5. theme change
        6. logout button


2. newsletter :
    before profile button create link /route for newsletter form (in carousel move option)
        1. default show free subscription for 1 category news (only 1 option choose from news category)
        2. multiple news category (monthly/yealy pricing in low price like 500 rs.)
    newsletter form can include detail like
        1. user name 
        2. user mail id 
        3. news categories option
     subscribe option(functional only when user login/signup)


thats fucking bad , i dont have time with this bullshit, do  it fast undersatnd my queris properly 
we are not making rocket simple community dpost pag ewith twitter alike posting method 
1. for newsletter u used carousel partition right use same partion in vertical parts for comminty post and creotor profile 
if user wants to like/ comment(initially empty ) a post of others ask user to create creotor profile(in the next carousel side)
use can create cretor profile with user name , nickname, 
and now they are ready to like/comment and also create their own post
for creating own post allow user to form deatils of descrip, along with media upload option of any file (handle image visibilty with in the post card display)
user created post will be visible in community post secction
user can also edit /delete theier own post in my post section

2.in community post user can like / comments other post or their own post
3.in edit profile page include details to cretae a creator profile
    details:
        username
        nickname(both can be edited)
    after cretor profile creation ,****create post option****- for creating forms that allow user to post with description , with media like image, video or anything, mainig image size , video size by suggesting user
                                    ***my post option to edit delete post of own **
